                Maria Santos is a visual artist who explores themes of identity and perception 
                through vibrant, expressive paintings. Born with cerebral palsy, Maria has 
                developed unique techniques that allow her to create intricate brushwork and 
                textures that have become her signature style.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Art gave me a voice when I felt I had none. Through my paintings, I can 
                share how I see the world â€“ not defined by disability, but enriched by my 
                unique perspective."
              </p>
              <p>
                Maria's work has been exhibited in galleries across the country and featured 
                in several publications focused on contemporary art. She also leads workshops 
                for aspiring artists with disabilities, sharing her techniques and passion for 
                creative expression.
